# About Project 
The PHP Quiz App will present ten (10) math addition questions, each with three answer options, and only one answer is correct. The quiz questions will be reshuffled after all ten questions are answered. The answer buttons will also be reshuffled. A total score will be presented after all questions have been answered.

Base files contaning HTML, CSS, the array of quiz questions, were provided.


# The Logic 
`questions.php` contains the array of questions and related answers.

`quiz.php` contains the logic for the application.

`index.php` displays the content of the quiz.

`header.php` contains header information and the `session_start()` for the app.
